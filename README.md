## Data Visualization

In this repo, I included some of the charts for data visualization using one of the most common and popular JS library D3.JS.
I Used sample CSV data from generating charts but you can go with JSON or any other type by doing some basics changes.
You can also try NVd3.JS library in place of D3.JS. 

So, choice is yours and call as well.
Just do it.
