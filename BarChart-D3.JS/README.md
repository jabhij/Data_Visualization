Creating Bar charts using CSV data and D3.JS

In many applications, sometimes we need to use data from CSV files, SQL Server tabular data, JSON data, flat file and so on. 
In data visualization (In generating charts like bar, pie, line charts and so on and diagrams) depending on the requirements.
his creates problems for developers since usually they don't know about:

- How to do that?
- What they need to use?
- What will be the better way of doing that?
- What kind of rough data required?
- How to parse data?
- How to convert data from one to another form?
- How to represent?
- And so on. So in this repository I'll try to explain it via a demo snipet.
